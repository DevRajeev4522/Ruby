# each iterator 
#The loop iterator is the simplest, but also one of the least powerful. A more useful iterator is the .each method, which can apply an expression to each element of an object, one at a time. The syntax looks like this:

#object.each do |item| 
  # Do something 
#end

#The variable name between | | can be anything you like: it’s just a placeholder for each element of the object you’re using .each on.

  #SPLAT MATHOD 
  #What is splat mathod?
  #Speaking of not knowing what to expect: your methods not only don’t know what arguments they’re going to get ahead of time but occasionally, they don’t even know how many arguments there will be.

  # def friend(name):
  #   puts "My friend is " + name + "."
  # end

  #This is great for just one friend, but what if you want to print out the all of the user’s friends, without knowing how many friend names the user will put in ahead of time?

  #The solution: splat arguments. Splat arguments are arguments preceded by a *, which tells the program that the method can receive one or more arguments.

  # def hello(greeting, *names) # parameters can not be string 
  #   names.each do |name| puts "#{greeting}, #{name}" 
  #   end  
  # end

  # hello("welcome", "Ravi", "Sonu", "kanak", "Arun") # calling mathod
 
  #return is used to return the value on console.

  # def double(n)
  #   return n * 2
  # end

  # def add(a,b)
  #   return (a + b)
  # end 

  # puts add(8,9)

  # def by_five(n)

  # def greeter(name)
  #   return "Hello, #{name}"
  # end 

  # puts greeter("shubh")

  # def by_three?(n)
  #   if n % 3 == 0 
  #     return true

  #   else 
  #     return false
  #   end 
  # end 

  # puts by_three?(6)


  #how blocks differ from the mathods 
  #There are some differences between blocks and methods, however.

  #Check out the code in the editor. The capitalize method capitalizes a word, and we can continually invoke the capitalize method by name. We can capitalize("matz"), capitalize("eduardo"), or any string we like to our hearts’ content.

  #However, the block that we define (following .each) will only be called once, and in the context of the array that we are iterating over. It appears just long enough to do some work for each, then vanishes into the night.

  #Ruby Combinbed Operator 

  # my_array = [8,6,1,4,3,5,7,]

  # my_array.sort!  do |first_num, second_num| second_num <=> first_num end 

  #   puts my_array #Sorting num to the descending order

#
# Ruby Combined Comparison Operator
# In Ruby, the combined comparison operator, <=>, also known as the spaceship operator is used to compare two objects. It returns 0 if the first operand equals the second, 1 if the first operand is greater than the second, and -1 if the first operand is less than the second.

# puts "Keanu" <=> "Adrianna" # The first letters of each word are compared in ASCII order and since "K" comes after "A", 1 is printed.
 
# puts 1 <=> 2 # -1
 
# puts 3 <=> 3 # 0
 
#<=> can also be used inside of a block and to sort values in descending order:
# my_array = [3, 0, 8, 7, 1, 6, 5, 9, 4]
# my_array.sort! { |first_num, second_num| second_num <=> first_num }
# print my_array
# #Output => [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 1, 0]
 
 
# Ruby Method Splat
# In a Ruby method, a splat (*) operator is used to indicate that a parameter can have an unknown number of arguments.

# def extra_curriculars(*clubs)
#   clubs.each do |club| puts "After school, i am involeved with #{club}" end 
# end 

# extra_curriculars("chess club", "gymnastic club", "cricket club", "football club", "kabaddi club")


#RUBY BLOCK PARAMETERS


# Ruby Block Parameter
# In Ruby, a method can take a block as a parameter.

# Passing a block to a method is a great way of abstracting certain tasks from the method and defining those tasks when we call the method.
# The block, {|i| puts i}, is passed the current array item each time it is evaluated. This block prints the item. 
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].each { |i| puts i }

#Ruby Return Mathod
# In Ruby, the return keyword is used to pass back a value from a method.

# def generous_tip(bill)
#   return bill * (0.25)
# end
 
# puts generous_tip(100) # 25

# print my_array
#Output => [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 1, 0]
 
 
# Ruby Method Splat
# In a Ruby method, a splat (*) operator is used to indicate that a parameter can have an unknown number of arguments.

#The * preceding the parameter "clubs" allows for multiple arguments to be passed into the method when you actually call it.
# def extra_curriculars(*clubs)
#   clubs.each { |club| puts "After school, I'm involved with #{club}" }
# end
 
# extra_curriculars("chess club", "gymnastics", "anime club", "library services")
 
#Output
#After school, I'm involved with chess club
#After school, I'm involved with gymnastics
#After school, I'm involved with anime club
#After school, I'm involved with library services
# Ruby Block Parameter
# In Ruby, a method can take a block as a parameter.

# Passing a block to a method is a great way of abstracting certain tasks from the method and defining those tasks when we call the method.

# # The block, {|i| puts i}, is passed the current array item each time it is evaluated. This block prints the item.

# Ruby Return
# In Ruby, the return keyword is used to pass back a value from a method.

# def generous_tip(bill)
#   return bill * (0.25)
# end
 
# generous_tip(100) # 25
 

#In this example, the generous_tip method is returning the product of bill and 0.25. In order to see that value, a "puts" or "print" can be added before the method call.

# Ruby Sort Method
# In Ruby, the .sort array method is used to sort items in an array in ascending order (least to greatest).

# my_array = [9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]
# my_array.sort!  # Sort is used sort the numbers in the ascendeng order

# print my_array


# RUBY BLOCK 


# n Ruby, a block is a section of code defined within the keywords do and end or with curly braces {}. This is usually preceded by an integer followed by .times to indicate how many times the code is to be executed.

# 2.times do
#   puts "I'm a code block!"
# end  

# 3.times { puts "So am I!" }

# def alphabetize(arr, rev = false) #second parameter is for reverse the array by defualt it is false 
#   arr.sort! 
#   if rev == true
#     arr.reverse!
#   else 
#     arr 
#   end 
# end 

# number = [6,5,4,3,2,1]

# puts alphabetize(number)


#HASHs AND SYMBOLS 

#iteration oVer Hashes 

# matz = {"First Name" => "Rajeev", "Rajeev" => "Parmar", "Age" => 27, "Nationality" => "Indian", "NickName" => "Shiny"}

# matz.each do  |key, value|
#   puts "#{value}"
# end 


#Nill In Ruby 
#What happens if you try to access a key that doesn’t exist, though?

# In many languages, you’ll get an error of some kind. Not so in Ruby: you’ll instead get the special value nil.

# Along with false, nil is one of two non-true values in Ruby. (Every other object is regarded as “truthy,” meaning that if you were to type if 2 or if "bacon", the code in that if statement would be run.)

# It’s important to realize that false and nil are not the same thing: false means “not true,” while nil is Ruby’s way of saying “nothing at all.”

# creatures = {"mamels" => "Elephant", "insects" => "ant", "reptiles" => "lizard"}  

# puts creatures["mamels"]
# puts creatures["insects"]
# puts creatures["reptiles"]
# puts creatures["birds"] #is giving a blank value which is called nill 

#Default value in Hash 
#You don’t have to settle for nil as a default value, however. If you create your hash using the Hash.new syntax, you can specify a default like so:
# my_hash = Hash.new("Trady Blix")

# puts my_hash["syurup"] #returning a default value
# no_nil_hash = Hash.new("nil")
# puts no_nil_hash["syrup"]



#Symbols in ruby 
#What's a Symbol?
# #You can think of a Ruby symbol as a sort of name. It’s important to remember that symbols aren’t strings:
# "string" == :string # false




#SYMBOLS SYNTAX in RUBY

# my_first_symnbol = :user


# What are Symbols Used For?
# Symbols pop up in a lot of places in Ruby, but they’re primarily used either as hash keys or for referencing method names.
# Symbols make good hash keys for a few reasons:

# They’re immutable, meaning they can’t be changed once they’re created;
# Only one copy of any symbol exists at a given time, so they save memory;
# Symbol-as-keys are faster than strings-as-keys because of the above two reasons.


# symbol_hash = {:one => 1, :two => 2, :three => 3, :four => 4} 

# puts "#{symbol_hash}"


#CONVERTING STRING TO THE SYMBOLS 
# strings = ["HTML", "CSS", "JAVASCRIPT", "PYTHON", "RUBY"]

# symbols = []

# strings.each do |s|
#   symbols.push(s.to_sym)
# end 

# InTERN in RUBy "Intern works as same as .to_sym it will also covert a string into symbols.

# EXAMPLE  
# "hello".intern

# => is called Hash Rocket in the Ruby 
# Change of Hash Rockets to : in Ruby 1.9
#Symbols key is working faster than string key in the Given example of code 
# require 'benchmark'

# string_AZ = Hash[("a".."z").to_a.zip((1..26).to_a)]

# symbols_AZ = Hash[(:a..:z).to_a.zip((1..26).to_a)]

# string_time = Benchmark.realtime do 100_000.times {string_AZ["r"]} end 

#   puts string_time

# symbol_time = Benchmark.realtime do 100_000.times{symbols_AZ["r"]}end

#   puts symbol_time


#SELECT MATHOD 
#Becoming More Selective
# We know how to grab a specific value from a hash by specifying the associated key, but what if we want to filter a hash for values that meet certain criteria? For that, we can use .select.
# grades = { samiksha: 100,
#   bhavesh: 92,
#   harshit: 95,
#   krishna: 97
# }
 
# grades.select { |name, grade| grade <  97 
#   puts grades
# }
# ==> { :bob => 92, :chris => 95 }

# Collect MNathod
# The collect method takes a block and applies the expression in the block to every element in an array. Check it out:

# my_nums = [1, 2, 3]
# my_nums.collect { |num| num ** 2 }
# # ==> [1, 4, 9]
# If we look at the value of my_nums, though, we’ll see it hasn’t changed:

# my_nums
# # ==> [1, 2, 3]
# This is because .collect returns a copy of my_nums, but doesn’t change (or mutate) the original my_nums array. If we want to do that, we can use .collect! with an exclamation point:

# my_nums.collect! { |num| num ** 2 }
# # ==> [1, 4, 9]
# my_nums
# ==> [1, 4, 9]


# fibs = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]

# # Add your code below!

# doubled_fibs = fibs.collect do |num|  num * 2 end 

# puts doubled_fibs


# trip = [10,20,30,40,50,60]

# trip_num = trip.collect do |num| num  * 3  end 

# trip_num = trip.each do |num| num * 3 end

# puts "#{trip_num}"

# each , the collect method will yield each member of an Array to the block. But unlike . each (which just returns the original Array), . collect will collect the results in a new array and return that instead.

# def yield_name(name)
#   puts "In the method! Let's yield."
#   yield("Kim")
#   puts "In between the yields!"
#   yield(name)

  # A lambda is just like a proc, only it cares about the number of arguments it gets and it returns to its calling method rather than returning immediately.
